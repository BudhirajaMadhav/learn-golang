# LEXER AND TYPES
## The standard (lexer):
    - It says "The formal grammar uses semicolons ";" as terminators in a number of productions."
    - But we can omit ";" coz there's a thing called lexer which adds those semicolons before compilation.

## TYPES: Everything is a type in golang
    - String
    - Bool
    - Integer   -> unit8, unint64, int8, int64, uintptr
    - Floating  -> float32, float64
    - Complex
    - Arrays
    - Slices
    - Maps
    - Structs
    - Pointers

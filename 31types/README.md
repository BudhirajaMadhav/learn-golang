# Types
What did I understand of type?
- There are some predefined types in go and some custom types that you can define.
- Those custom defined types can be of different types. For example, you can define a type that is a slice of strings. Or, you can define a type that is a map of strings to integers. Or, you can define a type that is a map of strings to slices of strings.
- Those all will be considered as different types called defined types. 
- Types can be of structs, interfaces, pointers, maps, slice, arrays, functions, channels, and more.


Types can be declared in two ways:
- 1st is the alias declarations.
  - This is just the alias and does contain all the methods and fields of the type.
- other is the type definitions.
    - This is the actual type and does not contain the methods and fields of the type.
